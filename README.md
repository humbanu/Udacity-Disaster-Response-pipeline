# Udacity-Disaster-Response-pipeline
Required for Udacity Data scientist nanodegree program

# Description
The dataset in contains over twenty-six thousand text messages from sources like news and social media. We got this data from Figure Eight/ Appen.com. Our goal is to build a Machine learning model for an API that classifies disaster messages. In achieving this goal we can provide help to disaster relief agencies. 

Udacity has divided our project into 3 sections:

1.) Data Processing, ETL pileline to extract the data from its source clean it and save in proper structure
2.) ML pipeline to train model to classify texts into categories
3.) Web App to show model results in real time. 

#Requirements
Python 3.5+
NLTK for natural language processing (converting text data into numerical data)
Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn, sqlalchemy for data processing and machine learning
Matplotlib, seaborn, plotly for data visualizations
Flask, back-end of our minimalistic web app
